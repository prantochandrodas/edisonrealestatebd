This diplomatic theory was brought into effect in the early 20th century where war torn countries decided to have a buffer zone between disputed border lines. It resolved disputes regarding historical claims over land. In the modern world, claims have somehow trespassed the borders and entered into the lives of daily city dwellers; but it has taken a different form altogether. It has shaped into what many might term as the \u201cancestral upper hand\u201d. Modern living instruments have put people into shared spaces through apartments and planned neighborhoods. When you purchase apartments and move into a new shared community, you would always want to stand your ground and move in as an equal. However, at most instances the stakes are in favor of former land owners, who have given out their land to the development company or real estate firm. When most realtors offer a significant share of the developed building instead of buying out the propertyoutright, the balance of ownership at your purchased apartment building is tilted towards the former landowners. In this case you might be left with uneven placement and share of the land, less of a say in common building community rules, and face more of what we just termed as \u201cancestral upper hand\u201d from your very neighbors who cannot help it because that is also true. <br \/><br \/>Usual problems that might fall in your plate could come in the form of restriction to use the rooftop, difficulties in washing the car inside the parking area, or even use of tap water for car wash. Sometimes the ground staff may seem to not obey anyone else but the true landowner. It could be termed as a complex authoritative attitude that they pose leads to certain elements like their unwillingness to evenly pay for common utility bills and put extra fees on the shoulders of other residents.<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"413\" src=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad-1024x413.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad-1024x413.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad-300x121.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad-768x310.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ad.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EDISON REAL ESTATE for instance, develops real estate in fully purchased own land.
