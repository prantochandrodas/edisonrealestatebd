For most people the location and price point are the key decisive factors when choosing a new home. However, the simplest of things that are overlooked become your toughest pain points while adjusting in a new home. So what really is a good apartment design?<\/p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An apartment that you purchase is set to become your home for the coming years. A place where you come back from work, shed off your troubles from the outside world and seek peace. Thus, it is important to figure out the small yet important features and amenities that will help you achieve the ultimate coziness that you\u2019d yearn for.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Expansive inside and out<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-327\" width=\"-105\" height=\"-97\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/1-1.jpg 630w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/1-1-300x281.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A fantastic entry that does not really reveal the true size of your entire house, be it small or large, leaving some room to create a mystery for first time visitors. A nice and wide bedroom, where the bed and closet does not occupy most of your space. Well-suited bathrooms that allow your guests to retain their impression of you. Most importantly a well-lit environment that allows enough natural light into your premises so that you are always part of the city you live in. Because like Louis Kahn said, \u201ca room is not a room without natural light\u201d.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Space for everyone, at every corner<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2-1024x853.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-329\" width=\"594\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2-1024x853.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2-300x250.jpg 300w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2-768x640.jpg 768w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2-1536x1280.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-2.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet, do not get carried away to please your guests more than you would accommodate your family. The occupants should be the number one priority. If you are moving into a new house with kids, make sure they have that space to play some ball or catch. Edison Real Estate takes precise measures to make sure this happens. A wide rooftop or an on-ground play area ensures a lively environment for the little ones. If you\u2019re moving in elderlies, do know that there always is a healthy circulation of fresh air. Let them enjoy a nice and cozy balcony from where they can experience the fast changing new world. High-speed elevators, and wheelchair ramps are few things to look out for.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-3-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><strong>Where the daily actions take place<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you forgetting the main utility area? Yes, the kitchen itself! Keep a sharp eye on that space, you do not want a less than comfortable cook to prep your meals. The placement of it in the apartment design should be in balanced order so that the heat and kitchen functions do not bother the other rooms.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Take a deep dive into design thinking<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know there are beautiful looking apartments popping up every now and then where you are planning to set up your next home; but remember \u201call that shines are not gold\u201d. Take the extra time to learn from the realtors their thought behind the design, and their vision to accommodate your needs. You might truly be able to picture the vision behind the architect&#8217;s purpose. Does the driveway to your parking space make sense for your cherished car? Is the communal space befitting to cater to your need to host a warm get together with your loved ones? Can the overall styling of the apartment stand the test of time?<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-331\" width=\"443\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-4.jpg 720w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-4-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/image-4-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The design concept of Edison Real Estate\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/projects?category=%23&amp;type=%23&amp;location=Bashundhara+R%2FA\">each project in Bashundhara R\/A<\/a>, like <a href=\"https:\/\/edisonrealestatebd.com\/projects\/edison-titania\">EDISON TITANIA<\/a> entails the ease of living for its occupants with well-planned circulation and endless facilities like an infinite edged swimming pool, active gymnasium, playing space for children along with a walking track to keep you healthy; also featuring with modern amenities designed with nature in center.
